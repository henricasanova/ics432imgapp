# ics432imgapp

This is a simple Java/JavaFX Application with which users can apply filters
to to batches of image (jpg) files, and which serves as a basis for
all ICS432 programming assignments. 

The application is structured as a Maven project, with all source code in the 
`src/` directory and the Maven configuration in the `pom.xml` file.

The `external_filters` directory contains additional image filters implemented in C, which will be relevant for the last programming assignment. See `README` file within.
