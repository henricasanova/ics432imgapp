Notes from FALL 2020:

Starter code is all good, but some fixes were done after my solutions where
developed. Some stuff was fixed later though. Probably a good idea to re-implement solutions from scratch anyway.


  - My solutions have the messed up /tmp stuff
  - My solutions has a bug for task-parallelism  (use a separate filter object!!)
  - "I have been going through your solution and I noticed that in
    MultiThreadedJob, you do not update your stats window for the speeds
    and the number of jobs. Also when I added that in, you also do not add
    up the number of bytes for the total size of the files. I added those
    in but just thought I would let you know."
  - My MedianFilter() should allocate RAM (fixed in weird pull request)
